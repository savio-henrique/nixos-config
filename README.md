# My NixOS configuration

A little dive into my configuration and its components and modules.

One's personal system configuration is always on WIP, as this is a living beast. Have fun trying to decypher what I'm doing. :laughing:

## Reestructured Configuration

Utilizing the SaschaKoenig's [Nixos Config Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43VvFgPsPtY&list=PLCQqUlIAw2cCuc3gRV9jIBGHeekVyBUnC) and Misterio77's [Nixos Config] as models and guides, I've reestructured my config as to satisfy these conditions:
* Be more modular;
* Have multiple hosts/users;
* Be more readable and maintainable.
* Be more secure.
* Have different configurations for different machines/hosts.
